//loitering
observed in array implementation of stack
Set removed item to null
garbage collector can reclaim memory only if no outstanding references 
//basic array implementation of stacks
//resizing arrays
how to grow and shrink array?
Increase array size each time capacity is exceeded - this is ~ N^2
double array size  this is only ~N
Stack: amortized cost of adding to a stack
How to shrink an array
naive, try halving
get a phenomenon called `Thrashing', constant resizing of array 
wait until an array gets 1/4 full until you halve it
INVARIANT: array is always between 25% and 100% full

Implemented 
LinkedStackOfStrings.java
ResizingArrayStackOfStrings.java

Using Generics and Iterators

Stack.java (using linkedlist)
FixedCapacityStack.java (using arrays)

Iterators + generics 

StackIterator (implements iterable)
StackArrayIterator (as above)

Test (examines functionality of Stack and Fixed Capacity stack)
