Notes on implementation

1. Comparable requires the compareTo() method to be implemented
class that implements comparable will be comparable, meaning that instances can be compared with each other
(we need to @Override the compare function
2. Class that implements Comparator will be used in two situations:
Can be passed into a sort method, such as Collections.sort(), or Arrays.sort(), 
It can also be used to control the order of certain data structure such as sorted sets or sorted maps.

3. I have implemented the example Comparators as shown in the notes for Student.java.

I have implemented Merge with improvements and sym-linked insertion for the optimisation (small arrays)
currently have implemented examples of both an integer and char sort, using the associated wrapper classes 
(test whether comparable could be used here)

To do
Convex hull - complete the implementation
